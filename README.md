## Coding the Humanities

Many scholars in the humanities and in other disciplines are skeptical about programming. Not only does it seem difficult to learn, it often isn't clear how programming could be relevant to a scholars daily practice. 

There are tonnes of free tutorials on any aspect of programming on a broad range of programming languages, but very few address how it could be used in research environments, especially within the Humanities.

In this workshop we will only scratch the surface of learning how to programme your own software packages and tools or modify existing tools. We will focus more on how coding is related to humanities research, both in terms of its use in research and in terms of how the humanities can offer an interesting perspective on coding.
